 * A synchronous implementation of Deferrer, that does the additional processing prior to the "ack" HTTP response.
 *
 * Since async processing in PHP generally requires additional infrastructure or services, this implementation avoids
 * that by doing the additional processing immediately (before the "ack" HTTP response is actually sent to Slack). This
 * works as great default implementation for the HttpServer, but is still subject to Slack's 3-second timeout. If more
 * than 3 seconds is needed to process a Slack request, then a different deferrer implementation is needed.
